# CurricuLogic — Pilot Offer & ROI (one pager)

Problem
Accreditation mapping and committee prep can require 8–12 hours of manual work per review cycle.

Solution
CurricuLogic centralizes mappings and automates auditor-ready exports so committees spend less time on data aggregation and more on curriculum quality.

Pilot Offer
- 60–90 day pilot
- Customized onboarding and import assistance
- Early-adopter pricing and product influence

Sample ROI (conservative)
- Time saved per accreditation cycle: 8 hours → 2 hours (6 hours saved)
- If an administrative hour is valued at $50, per-cycle savings = $300
- For 3 cycles/year or across multiple programs, ROI compounds quickly.

Next steps
- Sign pilot LOI and schedule kickoff.
- Provide a CSV export or use our template for import.
