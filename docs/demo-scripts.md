# Demo scripts for NEean (Nov 7)

## 2-minute elevator demo
1. Intro (20s): Who you are and CurricuLogic in one sentence: 'CurricuLogic turns curriculum spreadsheets into a single source of truth for mapping, assessment, and accreditation reporting.'
2. Problem (20s): Explain the pain of spreadsheet-based mapping and committee prep.
3. Live demo highlight (60s): Show import (CSV), map a course to an outcome, and export a PDF report.
4. Close (20s): Pilot offer and call to action: 60–90 day pilot with onboarding and early-adopter pricing.

## 10-minute deep demo
1. Intro & problem framing (60s)
2. Import walkthrough (2m): show the LMS-friendly CSV import, column mapping, and preview.
3. Mapping UI (3m): demonstrate editor role creating mappings, adding notes, and mapping strength.
4. Reporting (2m): generate compliance roll-up, filter by outcome/program, export CSV/PDF.
5. Admin/roles (1m): show role switching (Admin -> Editor -> Reviewer) and activity log snippet.
6. Q&A & pilot CTA (1m)

## Backup recorded demo script (for reliability)
- 3–4 minute screen-recorded walkthrough covering the same import→map→report flow. Host the video on a stable link (Vercel deploy or private YouTube unlisted) and use it if live demo connectivity fails.
